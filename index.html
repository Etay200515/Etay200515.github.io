        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>⅓ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
          <li>½ cup milk</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
          <li>1 onion, diced</li>
          <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
          <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
          <li>2 eggs</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          <li>¼ bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
          <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.
            Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion;
            cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about
            5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring
            until onion is very tender, about 15 minutes more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gently stir beef and pork together in a large bowl. Add onions,
            bread crumb mixture, eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt,
            black pepper, Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes; mix
            together using a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and
            refrigerate for about one hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Form mixture into
            balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter; arrange in a single layer on
            the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until browned
            and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>4 large eggs</li>
          <li>2 cups of milk</li>
          <li>Vanilla (<i>to taste</i>)</li>
          <li>2 cups of sugar</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="instructions-2">
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start by making the caramel. Put the sugar into a saucepan and heat
            over medium-low, stirring frequently, until it turns into a golden
            brown syrup. In the meantime, place your ramekins on a baking tray
            and surround them with hot water (bain-marie).
          </li>

          <li>
            Pour the caramel into the ramekins. Then make the custard. Start by
            cracking the eggs into a large mixing bowl. Add the sugar and beat
            until creamy.
          </li>

          <li>
            Add the milk and vanilla and beat until well combined. Then pour
            into the ramekins.
          </li>

          <li>
            Cover with foil and put in the oven. Bake for about 40 minutes
            (until just set — the size of your mold will affect the time). Then
            remove them from the water and let them come to room temperature.
            Finally, put them in the fridge overnight (or for at least 6 hours).
            Finally, it’s time to eat your flan! Remove the foil and run a
            butter knife around the edge of the mold. Flip carefully onto a
            serving plate and enjoy!
